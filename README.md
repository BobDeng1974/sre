SRE (Shadow Rendering Engine) is an optimized real-time 3D
rendering using OpenGL or OpenGL-ES 2.0 with several device-
specific back-ends.

NOTE: The current initial code drop as of Feb 2014 has only been tested
with OpenGL on a PC platform; the OpenGL-ES 2.0 X11 front-end most likely
does not compile due to restructuring of the front-end interface and may
have bugs. A previous version of SRE worked correctly with OpenGL-ES 2.0,
and it should not be a lot of work to make it compile and work correctly
again. Framebuffer OpenGL-ES front-ends may require more work.

See the file README for further instructions.
